<p><em><strong>The year 2020-2021 has been one extraordinary year. It made humanity question and realize a lot of things and proved that wealth is nothing without health. As another year begins, it is important to be grateful that with all the things that have happened in the past year, we are still here alive and continuing to survive.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The Social Action Office of the City Bacolod would like to spread a message of hope in order to start this New Year right. As a volunteer of the Social Action Office of the city, you were tasked to organize an advocacy show featuring various artworks of the youth and their messages of hope.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Since gathering in a large crowd is still not advisable, you are tasked to submit your artwork made up of quadrilaterals and your advocacy for hope in not less than 5 sentences through a leaflet and will be featured in the social media pages of the city of Bacolod.</strong></em></p>
Specific tasks for the Performance Task:
<p>
Draw an artwork made up of quadrilaterals.
The said artwork should be based on the theme, HOPE.
Write a message of hope for all of those who were greatly affected by the pandemic and explain the relevance of your design to the theme in not less than 5 sentences.
